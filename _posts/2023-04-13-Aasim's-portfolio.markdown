This is Day 1 of me trying to learn Jekyll let's see how it goes. So far its very easy but initially i had difficulty setting up the environment because i installed the ruby version without the devkit using the choco command line which was pretty lazy for me. As of now the myblog project is working smoothly but lets see what happens. I couldn't run the portfolio template because of some dependency issues and now its 5'o clock in the morning and i dont really feel like doing it. So lets just vent on this stupid blog post i am creating for the world to see or maybe no one ever will so i guess it really doesnt matter. i guess my spotlight syndrome will take me down some day. Haha Lol!
